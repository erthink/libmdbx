Unfortunately, on 2022-04-15 the Github administration, without any
warning nor explanation, deleted _libmdbx_ along with a lot of other
projects, simultaneously blocking access for many developers. Therefore
on 2022-04-21 we have migrated to a reliable trusted infrastructure.
The origin for now is at[GitFlic](https://gitflic.ru/project/erthink/libmdbx)
with backup at [ABF by ROSA Лаб](https://abf.rosalinux.ru/erthink/libmdbx).
For the same reason ~~Github~~ is blacklisted forever.

So currently most of the links are broken due to noted malicious ~~Github~~ sabotage.
