Thin abstraction layer for libmdbx
Implements an easy to use API for working with libmdbx databases
It implements in-order memory management to avoid invalid memory access

All C enums and their values are translated into enums and user readable values
Bitwise ORing is implemented for the related enums.

Because it's a thin abstraction, the meaning of all parameters, modes, and constants are the same.

The documentation provided is largely taken from the C API headers.
For the enums, the help texts are only available in the python file because there's no reasonable
way to embed it into the declarations without replicating all declarations in the help text itself

Compare functions are not bound because it is better to handle that

Attribute support is available if it is compiled in libmdbx

Purely internal functions like b-tree traversal related or range query estimation related are not bound

    # The database lock file is the path with "-lck" appended.

    # - with `MDBX_NOSUBDIR` = in a filesystem we have the pair of MDBX-files
    #   which names derived from given pathname by appending predefined suffixes.

    # - without `MDBX_NOSUBDIR` = in a filesystem we have the MDBX-directory with
    #   given pathname, within that a pair of MDBX-files with predefined names.

    # filesystems, where MDBX does not use locks.

    # - with `MDBX_RDONLY` = open environment in read-only mode.
    #   MDBX supports pure read-only mode (i.e. without opening LCK-file) only
    #   when environment directory and/or both files are not writable (and the
    #   LCK-file may be missing). In such case allowing file(s) to be placed
    #   on a network read-only share.

    # which don't supported by MDBX.
    # In this way, you can get the minimal overhead, but with the correct
    # multi-process and multi-thread locking.

    # - with `MDBX_EXCLUSIVE` = open environment in exclusive/monopolistic mode
    #   or return \ref MDBX_BUSY if environment already used by other process.
    #   The main feature of the exclusive mode is the ability to open the
    #   environment placed on a network share.

    # - without `MDBX_EXCLUSIVE` = open environment in cooperative mode
    #   i.e. for multi-process access/interaction/cooperation.
    #   The main requirements of the cooperative mode are:

    #   1. data files MUST be placed in the LOCAL file system
    #      but NOT on a network share.
    #   2. environment MUST be opened only by LOCAL processes

    # bad updates into the database. This may be slightly faster for DBs that
    # fit entirely in RAM, but is slower for DBs larger than RAM. Also adds the
    # possibility for stray application writes thru pointers to silently
    # corrupt the database.

    # - with `MDBX_WRITEMAP` = all data will be mapped into memory in the
    #   read-write mode. This offers a significant performance benefit, since the
    #   data will be modified directly in mapped memory and then flushed to disk
    #   by single system call, without any memory management nor copying.

    # - without `MDBX_WRITEMAP` = data will be mapped into memory in the
    #   read-only mode. This requires stocking all modified database pages in
    #   memory and then writing them to disk through file operations.

    # \warning On the other hand, `MDBX_WRITEMAP` adds the possibility for stray
    # application writes thru pointers to silently corrupt the database.

    # \note The `MDBX_WRITEMAP` mode is incompatible with nested transactions
    # since this is unreasonable. I.e. nested transactions requires mallocation
    # of database pages and more work for tracking ones, which neuters a
    # performance boost caused by the `MDBX_WRITEMAP` mode.

    # need this option. Such an application must also serialize the write
    # transactions in an OS thread, since MDBX's write locking is unaware of
    # the user threads.

    # \note Regardless to `MDBX_NOTLS` flag a write transaction entirely should
    # always be used in one thread from start to finish. MDBX checks this in a

    # than RAM and system RAM is full.

    # By default libmdbx dynamically enables/disables readahead depending on
    # the actual database size and currently available memory. On the other
    # hand, such automation has some limitation, i.e. could be performed only
    # when DB size changing but can't tracks and reacts changing a free RAM
    # availability, since it changes independently and asynchronously.

    # Don't initialize malloc'd memory before writing to datafile.

    # Don't initialize malloc'd memory before writing to unused spaces in the
    # data file. By default, memory for pages written to the data file is
    # obtained using malloc. While these pages may be reused in subsequent
    # transactions, freshly malloc'd pages will be initialized to zeroes before
    # use. This avoids persisting leftover data from other code (that used the
    # heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the data file.

    # Note that many other system libraries may allocate and free memory from
    # the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may use the heap for file I/O
    # buffers. This initialization step has a modest performance cost so some
    # applications may want to disable it using this flag. This option can be a
    # problem for applications which handle sensitive data like passwords, and
    # it makes memory checkers like Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed
    # with \ref MDBX_WRITEMAP, which writes directly to the mmap instead of using
    # malloc for pages. The initialization is also skipped if \ref MDBX_RESERVE

    # a Garbage Collection. Technically, when possible short lists of pages
    # will be combined into longer ones, but to fit on one database page. As a
    # result, there will be fewer items in Garbage Collection and a page lists
    # are longer, which slightly increases the likelihood of returning pages to

    # LIFO policy for recycling a Garbage Collection items.

    # `MDBX_LIFORECLAIM` flag turns on LIFO policy for recycling a Garbage
    # Collection items, instead of FIFO by default. On systems with a disk
    # write-back cache, this can significantly increase write performance, up
    # to several times in a best case scenario.

    # LIFO recycling policy means that for reuse pages will be taken which became
    # unused the lastest (i.e. just now or most recently). Therefore the loop of
    # database pages circulation becomes as short as possible. In other words
    # the number of pages, that are overwritten in memory and on disk during a
    # series of write transactions, will be as small as possible. Thus creates
    # ideal conditions for the efficient operation of the disk write-back cache.

    # \ref MDBX_LIFORECLAIM is compatible with all no-sync flags, but gives NO
    # noticeable impact in combination with \ref MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC or
    # \ref MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC. Because MDBX will reused pages only before the
    # last "steady" MVCC-snapshot, i.e. the loop length of database pages
    # circulation will be mostly defined by frequency of calling

    # \attention Using any combination of \ref MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC, \ref
    # MDBX_NOMETASYNC and especially \ref MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC is always a deal to
    # reduce durability for gain write performance. You must know exactly what
    # you are doing and what risks you are taking!

    # \note for LMDB users: \ref MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC is NOT similar to LMDB_NOSYNC
    # but \ref MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC is exactly match LMDB_NOSYNC. See details
    # below.

    # THE SCENE:
    # - The DAT-file contains several MVCC-snapshots of B-tree at same time
    #   each of those B-tree has its own root page.
    # - Each of meta pages at the beginning of the DAT file contains a
    #   pointer to the root page of B-tree which is the result of the particular
    #   transaction, and a number of this transaction.
    # - For data durability, MDBX must first write all MVCC-snapshot data
    #   pages and ensure that are written to the disk, then update a meta page
    #   with the new transaction number and a pointer to the corresponding new
    #   root page, and flush any buffers yet again.
    # - Thus during commit a I/O buffers should be flushed to the disk twice;
    #   i.e. fdatasync( FlushFileBuffers() or similar syscall should be
    #   called twice for each commit. This is very expensive for performance
    #   but guaranteed durability even on unexpected system failure or power
    #   outage. Of course, provided that the operating system and the
    #   underlying hardware (e.g. disk) work correctly.

    # TRADE-OFF:
    # By skipping some stages described above, you can significantly benefit in
    # speed, while partially or completely losing in the guarantee of data
    # durability and/or consistency in the event of system or power failure.
    # Moreover, if for any reason disk write order is not preserved, then at
    # moment of a system crash, a meta-page with a pointer to the new B-tree may
    # be written to disk, while the itself B-tree not yet. In that case, the
    # database will be corrupted!

    # Default robust and durable sync mode.

    # Metadata is written and flushed to disk after a data is written and
    # flushed, which guarantees the integrity of the database in the event
    # of a crash at any time.

    # \attention Please do not use other modes until you have studied all the
    # details and are sure. Otherwise, you may lose your users' data, as happens
    # in [Miranda NG](https://www.miranda-ng.org/) messenger./

    # the platform and hardware, with \ref MDBX_NOMETASYNC you may get a doubling
    # of write performance.

    # This trade-off maintains database integrity, but a system crash may
    # undo the last committed transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI
    # (atomicity, consistency, isolation) but not D (durability) database
    # property.

    # Don't sync anything but keep previous steady commits.

    # Like \ref MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC the `MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC` flag disable similarly
    # flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction. But there is a
    # huge difference in how are recycled the MVCC snapshots corresponding to
    # previous "steady" transactions (see below).

    # With \ref MDBX_WRITEMAP the `MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC` instructs MDBX to use
    # asynchronous mmap-flushes to disk. Asynchronous mmap-flushes means that
    # actually all writes will scheduled and performed by operation system on it
    # own manner, i.e. unordered. MDBX itself just notify operating system that
    # it would be nice to write data to disk, but no more.

    # Depending on the platform and hardware, with `MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC` you may get
    # a multiple increase of write performance, even 10 times or more.

    # In contrast to \ref MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC mode, with `MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC` flag
    # MDBX will keeps untouched pages within B-tree of the last transaction
    # "steady" which was synced to disk completely. This has big implications for
    # both data durability and (unfortunately) performance:
    #  - a system crash can't corrupt the database, but you will lose the last
    #    transactions; because MDBX will rollback to last steady commit since it
    #    kept explicitly.
    #  - the last steady transaction makes an effect similar to "long-lived" read
    #    transaction (see above in the \ref restrictions section) since prevents
    #    reuse of pages freed by newer write transactions, thus the any data
    #    changes will be placed in newly allocated pages.
    #  - to avoid rapid database growth, the system will sync data and issue
    #    a steady commit-point to resume reuse pages, each time there is
    #    insufficient space and before increasing the size of the file on disk.

    # In other words, with `MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC` flag MDBX insures you from the
    # whole database corruption, at the cost increasing database size and/or
    # number of disk IOPs. So, `MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC` flag could be used with
    # \ref mdbx_env_sync() as alternatively for batch committing or nested
    # transaction (in some cases). As well, auto-sync feature exposed by
    # \ref mdbx_env_set_syncbytes() and \ref mdbx_env_set_syncperiod() functions
    # could be very useful with `MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC` flag.

    # The number and volume of of disk IOPs with MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC flag will
    # exactly the as without any no-sync flags. However, you should expect a
    # larger process's [work set](https://bit.ly/2kA2tFX) and significantly worse
    # a [locality of reference](https://bit.ly/2mbYq2J due to the more

    # not yet flushed to disk. Depending on the platform and hardware, with
    # `MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC` you may get a multiple increase of write performance
    # even 100 times or more.

    # If the filesystem preserves write order (which is rare and never provided
    # unless explicitly noted) and the \ref MDBX_WRITEMAP and \ref
    # MDBX_LIFORECLAIM flags are not used, then a system crash can't corrupt the
    # database, but you can lose the last transactions, if at least one buffer is
    # not yet flushed to disk. The risk is governed by how often the system
    # flushes dirty buffers to disk and how often \ref mdbx_env_sync() is called.
    # So, transactions exhibit ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation) properties
    # and only lose `D` (durability). I.e. database integrity is maintained, but
    # a system crash may undo the final transactions.

    # Otherwise, if the filesystem not preserves write order (which is
    # typically) or \ref MDBX_WRITEMAP or \ref MDBX_LIFORECLAIM flags are used
    # you should expect the corrupted database after a system crash.

    # So, most important thing about `MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC`:
    #  - a system crash immediately after commit the write transaction
    #    high likely lead to database corruption.
    #  - successful completion of mdbx_env_sync(force = true) after one or
    #    more committed transactions guarantees consistency and durability.
    #  - BUT by committing two or more transactions you back database into
    #    a weak state, in which a system crash may lead to database corruption!
    #    In case single transaction after mdbx_env_sync, you may lose transaction
    #    itself, but not a whole database.

    # Nevertheless, `MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC` provides "weak" durability in case
    # of an application crash (but no durability on system failure and
    # therefore may be very useful in scenarios where data durability is
    # not required over a system failure (e.g for short-lived data or if you
    # can take such risk.

    # `MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC` flag may be changed at any time using
